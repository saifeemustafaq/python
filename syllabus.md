- writing and using constructors
- hasattr(), type(), issubclass(), isinstance(), super() functions
- using predefined exceptions and defining your own ones
- the try-except-else-finally block, the raise statement, the except-as variant
- exceptions hierarchy, assigning more than one exception to one except branch
- adding your own exceptions to an existing hierarchy
- assertions
- the anatomy of an exception object
- input/output basics: opening files with the open() function, stream objects, binary vs. text files, newline character translation, reading and writing files, bytearray objects
- read(), readinto(), readline(), write(), close() methods

# 5: Modules and Packages
